<p align="center"><b>Prototyping Development Tool for Vue Developers</b></p>

<p>OverVue is a prototyping tool that allows developers to dynamically create and visualize a Vue application, implementing a real-time intuitive tree display of component hierarchy and a live-generated code preview. The resulting boilerplate can be exported as a template for further development.</p>

<p>这个程序能帮你生成Vue 组件, 设置 routes , 也可以帮你显像Component Parent-Child组件树。你只要做一些小配置然后可以下载code boilerplate. 这样你就可以很方便简洁地生成Vue前台APP了！</p>

## How to use

- Upon opening the application a Connect to Slack button will appear. To skip this step click 'Skip'
- Click the button to open a browser window, log in to your Slack workspace and select a channel to send save notifications.
- If you have logged in to Slack, upon saving your project file you will receive a prompt with the option to notify your team.
  ![](./src/assets/readme/v4Slack_Oauth.gif)

- OverVue will assign a default root App component and a default route called "HomeView"
- Upload a mockup from your filesystem if you'd like. Remove the mockup and choose a new one if needed.
  ![](./src/assets/readme/v4Upload_image.gif)

- To add a new component, type its name in the component name box and select any HTML elements that should be rendered by that component.
- HTML elements can also be added after creation by selecting the component in the display, then selecting HTML elements.
- Select a parent component for the new component if needed.
- After adding, you can move and resize the component in the display.
  ![](./src/assets/readme/v4Creating_Component.gif)

- You can also duplicate components with Ctrl/Cmd C & V and see the component tree updated in real time.
- Duplicate components will appear offset from their original and retain the same state and route assignments.
  ![](./src/assets/readme/v4Copy_Child_Components.gif)

- Child components will inherit the same parents, but parent components will not inherit duplicate children.
  ![](./src/assets/readme/v4Copy_Parent_Component.gif)

- The right-side drawer displays live code snippets for the selected element.  
  ![](./src/assets/readme/v4Code_Snippet.gif)

- You can view and add new routes and associated components in the left-hand drawer.
  ![](./src/assets/readme/v4Copying_Route.gif)

- State and actions can be created, edited, and assigned to components.
  ![](./src/assets/readme/v4State_and_actions.gif)

- When finished creating, you can export to a file location of your choice. Below is the exported file structure:

```
public/
  index.html
src/
  assets/
  components/
    UserCreatedComponent1.vue
    UserCreatedComponent2.vue
    ...
  views/
    HomeView.vue
    UserCreatedRouteComponent1.vue
    UserCreatedRouteComponent2.vue
    ...
  App.vue
  main.js
  router.js
babel.config.js
package.json
```

## Installation

To download the development version for windows or mac, please visit https://www.Overvue.io

This app was developed using the Quasar framework, so first you will need to install the Quasar cli

```
npm i -g @quasar/cli
```

Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

To run electron app in dev mode (note: Vue Devtools will launch automatically)

```
quasar dev -m electron
```

To build a new .dmg / windows .exe

```
quasar build -m electron
```

### WSL Installation

**The ability to load the application and/or devtools requires a tool/application to run a linux display as WSL does not have any display drivers since it is based off of just a CLI.
I recommend X410 (https://x410.dev/), althought it does cost \$15, for ease of use. There are free options such as VcXsrv(https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) that you can get, but requires more set up.**

If you choose to use x410, you will need to set the environment DISPLAY variable on each console:

So, to open either the Vue devtools or OverVue in dev mode, first start your X Server then enter into the terminal:
For WSL 1 :

```
export DISPLAY=:0
```

For WSL 2 :

```
export DISPLAY=$(awk '/nameserver / {print $2; exit}' /etc/resolv.conf 2>/dev/null):0
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
```

followed by the command for the s or devmode. If you want both open, enter commands above followed by starting the devtools:

```
./node_modules/.bin/vue-devtools
```

Then open a new terminal instance, set the DISPLAY value again (re-enter above command for DISPLAY), and start OverVue in dev mode:

```
quasar dev -m electron
```
### Running as Containerized Docker Image

In your terminal, run :

```
docker run -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v`pwd`/src:/app/src --rm -it <OverVue file name> bash
```
## BETA
### Slack OAuth

For the Slack OAuth, you will need to create a Slack app through their website (https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1), so that you have your own Client Secret and Client ID. Then create two .env files (one for development and one for production).

1. Create a Slack App from the link above. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret somewhere safe.
2. Create two .env files in the main root of this repository. Name them:

```
.env
.env.development
```

3. Open .env and add these three environment variables. Replace <client secret> and <client id> with the client id and client secret given to you when you created your Slack App.

```
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET = "<client secret>"
SLACK_CLIENT_ID = "<client id>"
SLACK_REDIRECT_URI = "overvue://slack"
```

4. Next, open .env.development and do the same, just note that the SLACK_REDIRECT_URI will be different here:

```
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET = "<client secret>"
SLACK_CLIENT_ID = "<client id>"
SLACK_REDIRECT_URI = "overvuedev://test"
```

## Contributing

We'd love for you to test this application out and submit any issues you encounter. Also feel free to fork to your own repo and submit PRs.
Here are some features we're thinking about adding:


- Ability to place child components into HTML elements
- More semantic HTML tag options
- Ability to export Vuex store boilerplate
- Ability to add two-way binding to input elements
- More typing options for Typescript mode

If you make changes and wish to update the website, here is the link to the repo: https://github.com/TeamOverVue/OverVuePage
